🔑 Project Objectives

To develop a basic calculator using C++.

To understand and apply fundamental programming concepts like variables, conditionals, switch-case, and user input/output.

To perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

🛠️ Key Features

1. User Input Handling – Takes input from the user for numbers and operation type.


2. Arithmetic Operations – Supports +, -, *, and /.


3. Input Validation – Handles division by zero error gracefully.


4. Clear Output – Displays accurate results in a user-friendly format.


5. Modular Design (optional) – Can be extended using functions for each operation.

📚 Concepts Used

Input/Output using cin and cout

Conditional Statements (switch-case)

Basic Data Types (double, char)

Error Handling (e.g., division by zero)

💡 Possible Enhancements

Add a loop to perform multiple calculations until the user exits.

Add advanced operations like modulus, power, and square root.

Convert into a GUI app using libraries like Qt or GTK.

Implement using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

🧠 What I Learned

How to use C++ syntax for real-world applications.

How to handle user input and basic error-checking.

How to structure a console application.
