ðŸ’¼ Project Title: Currency Converter Using C++

 ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To develop a simple currency converter that allows users to convert amounts from one currency to another.

To improve understanding of basic C++ concepts like variables, input/output, and control structures.

ðŸ§© Key Features

1. User-Friendly Console Interface â€“ Easy-to-follow prompts for currency conversion.


2. Fixed Exchange Rates â€“ Uses predefined conversion rates for accurate calculations.


3. Multiple Currency Options â€“ Supports conversion from USD to INR, EUR, GBP, and JPY.


4. Formatted Output â€“ Displays currency symbols and two decimal places for readability.


ðŸ§  Concepts Used

Control Structures: switch-case

Constants and Arithmetic operations

iomanip for number formatting

ðŸš€ Possible Enhancements

Two-way conversion (e.g., INR to USD).

Menu-driven interface with looping.

Fetching real-time exchange rates using APIs.

Adding a GUI interface using Qt or SFML.

Logging conversions to a file for records/history.

ðŸ“š What I Learned
